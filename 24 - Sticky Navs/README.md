## Sticky Nav

- This project is building a sticky nav

## Extra Added

- Using getBoundingClientRect().top instead of offsetTop

## Why did I work on this project?

- In order to improve my JS skills

## What did I learn from this project?

- Difference between `getBoundingClientRect()` and `offsetTop`
  - getBoundingClientRect() : relative to the client viewport
  - offsetTop : relative to the it's container
- `width from 0 to auto` can not be animated

## How did I do this?

- HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript
