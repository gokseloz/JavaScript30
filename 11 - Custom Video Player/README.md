## Custom Video Player
- This project is about hiding the default controls for HTML5 video player and building all controls from stratch
- HTML and most of the CSS was already written but I also added new structure and styling by editing HTML and CSS files
- I wrote all of the JS. Original JS codes can also be found in JS file (down below and between comment lines) 

- ### Original Project
    - play&pause button
    - adjustable volume bar
    - adjustable video speed bar
    - clickable progress bar to skip the video
    - 10 sec backward and 25 sec forward buttons

- ### My extra added features
    - Full screen
        - clicking button on the top right or double click the video
    - Press spacebar to play/pause the video
    - Add volume and video-speed icons
        - volume icon changes when the volume is 0 / mute
    - Values of the volume and video-speed are visible and updating itself if values change
    - Add a display to show current video time and total video duration

## Why did I work on this project?
- In order to improve my JS skills

## What did I learn from this project?
- Generally how to `customize and manipulate video controls`
- making `full screen` and hiding controllers
- `e.offset` property
- `step` attribute for input[type="range"]
- `timeupdate Event` => occurs when the playing position of an audio/video changes and display the current position

## How did I do this?
- HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript

## Notes
- It was so much fun creating my own video controls. I really enjoyed with all of the features, getting their values, see the values on screen, making it full screen etc.
