## Array Cardio Day 2
- This part is the practice of some(), every(), find(), findIndex() methods
- JavaScript file contain both original course code and my way of code(Another way)

## Why did I work on this project?
- In order to improve my JS skills

## What did I learn from this project?
- How and where to use `some(), every(), find(), findIndex()` methods
- `slice()` method => extract a new array
    - slice(x) => begin extracting starting from index x until the end
    - slice(x,y) => begin extracting starting from index x until the index y(y is not included)
- `splice()` method => removing or replacing existings elements
    - splice(x) => remove all elements starting from index x
    - splice(x,y) => remove y element starting from index x (splice(1,2) => remove 2 elements starting from 1.index)
    - splice(x,y,z) => remove y element starting from index x and insert z

## How did I do this?
- Vanilla JavaScript
