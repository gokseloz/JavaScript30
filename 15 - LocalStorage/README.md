## LocalStorage
- This project is kind of a simulation of a restaurant menu, consist of using local storage

## Why did I work on this project?
- In order to improve my JS skills

## Extra added
- Delete button
    - deleting the each item both from the list and local storage
- Clear button
    - deleting the all items both from the list and local storage

## What did I learn from this project?
- form has `reset()` method (I have been using input.value = "" ðŸ¤£)
- remove the items from array with `arr.length = 0`

## How did I do this?
- HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript

## Notes
- At the moment, I am learning React and I understood the power of it much better while doing this project because;
    - Each time when we add/delete a item, `populateList()` is called and render the whole list again and again instead of just update the one single line. 
    - React updates only the parts which are changed
- I have already worked with localstorage before in "personal" and "kodluyoruz" todo projects
