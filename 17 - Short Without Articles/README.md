## Short Without Articles
- Sorting the items without considering their articles ("The", "An", "A")

## Why did I work on this project?
- In order to improve my JS skills

## Extra added
- My way to ignore the child element with css trick
```
h1 {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

- Original project to ignore the child element  
```
    if(this !== e.target){
    x = x + e.target.offsetLeft
    y = y + e.target.offsetLeft
 }
```

## What did I learn from this project?
- difference between `e.target and e.currentTarget`
- Object `destructuring`

## How did I do this?
- HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript

## Notes
- walk variable is for adjusting the spaces among shadows. The bigger value, the bigger spacing.
- importance of offset values
