## Slide in on Scroll
- Images will be visible/invisible while scrolling through the page by adding *active* class
    - get visible if the user scrolls more than halfway of the image and the image is still in view
    - otherwise get invisible

## Why did I work on this project?
- In order to improve my JS skills

## What did I learn from this project?
- `debouncing` function
- scrollY, scrollX, innerHeight, innerWidth, offsetTop

## How did I do this?
- HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript

## Notes
- It is better to use dev tools and see what results these properties(scroll,offset...) give.
