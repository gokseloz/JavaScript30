## Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes Add main page
- Selecting multiple checkboxes by pressing the Shift key

## Why did I work on this project?
- In order to improve my JS skills

## What did I learn from this project?
- Nothing new but the `way of thinking` and `structuring the logic` 

## How did I do this?
- HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript

## Notes
- Honestly this one was difficult to understand the whole concept, especially `this` usage which is still a bit confusing for me
- When I look at the final code, it seems not too hard to write but the logic behind it is the challenging part
- Maybe I should start working with `algorithmic thinking`
