## Ajax Type Ahead
- This part is about fetch API and more

## Why did I work on this project?
- In order to improve my JS skills

## What did I learn from this project?
- `Fetch API` to fetch the resources
- `then(), catch(), json()`
- Spread syntax `...`
- RegExp
    - `match(), replace()`
    - `gi` modifier 
        - `g` = global, match all instances of the pattern in a string, not just one
        - `i` = insensitive, /a/i will match the string "a" or "A".
        
## How did I do this?
- HTML,CSS and Vanilla JavaScript
